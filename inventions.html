        <h6>The Mouse</h6>
        <p>The mouse was invented by Douglas Engelbart in 1964. The appearance consisted of a wooden shell, circuit board and two metal wheels that came into contact with the surface it was being used on. Engelbart described his invention as an "X-Y position indicator for a display system". In 1972 (8 years later) his partner, Bill English, improved the design by inventing the ball mouse. Using a ball instead of wheels allowed the device to monitor movement in every direction instead of being limited to side-to-side, up and down. In present day, this invention is used by almost everyone to translate their physical motions into the motion of a pointer on a display.</p>

        <h6>Hypertext</h6>
        <p>Although Douglas Engelbart was not the "father" of hypertext, he played a role in it's developpement. In 1962, Engelbart started to independently work on his NLS (oN-Line System) at the Stanford Research Institute. Engelbart's NLS system was pioneered hypermedia such as hyperlinked text, diagrams, email, source code, etc. This led to the first demonstration of a hypertext interface to the public at The Mother of All Demos. In 1968, Douglas Engelbart also gave a live online hypermedia demonstration of the work he had accomplished at SRI.</p>
